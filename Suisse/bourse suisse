    les differentes depenses du aux lancement et la publicite qui sera tres importante

If it can be possible we will really appreciate a hosting (Cloud and database) fast enough to grow our traffic


Sometimes some projects do not need any funding, but there are others (especially those for which investments are needed) that require fundraising.

It will then be necessary to take the amount of the calculated financing and allocate:

    the staff we need to recruit (03 or 04 people for a start),
    expenses related to services, in particular the taxi company,
    the call center which is the heart of our company
    the various expenses due to the launch and the advertising which will be very important
